This Flutter app will allow you to take a title of a cool place you have bee, a photo of that place and also its location. You can then see all the places you have visited in a map and see the details of each place.

## Key Features

- **Add a title**: add a title to the place you want to save.
- **Take a photo**: take a photo of the place you want to save.
- **Add a location**: you can either add the location manually or use the device's current location.

## Try my app!

The attached files **DO NOT** work as a standalone project, they are just the code I wrote (lib folder), pubspecs (dependencies) and assets.  

To give the app a try:
-  [Download the Flutter SDK and Android Studio or Xcode](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
-  Start a virtual device in Android Studio or Xcode.
-  Clone my repository and move to that location in your terminal.
-  Run `flutter create .` in the terminal. (this will create all the app dependencies).
-  Run `flutter run`. The virtual device will open the app automatically.
-  That's it!
